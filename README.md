# Coffee Shop Sales - SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis
*A complete end-to-end case study demonstrating real data cleaning, transformation, preparation and analysis workflow.*

---

## Project Overview
This project uses a ***Kaggle Coffee Shop Sales Dataset*** to simulate a real-world data analysis workflow.
The goal is to:

- Clean and prepare raw data
- Understand business context before cleaning
- Transform messy data into structured, analysable form
- Create meaningful insights through visualisations

This project simulates a **real-world data analyst workflow** - similar to what I will do in professional roles.

## Dataset Source

- Origin : Kaggle Dataset
- Format : CSV
- Imported into : **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- Total Rows : `XXXX` (to add later)
- Total Columns : `XXXX` (to add later)

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|-------------------------|
| SQL Server (SSMS) | Data import, cleaning, transformation, export with SQL queries |
| Google Sheets | Quick checks, Pivot Tables & Visualizations |
| Jupyter Lab / Notepad / Markdown | Workflow Documentation |
| GitHub | Portfolio & version control |

## Business Problem
The coffee shop wants to:

- Understand sales patterns
- Identify peak hours
- Improve stock & staffing decisions
- Track product perfromance
- Analyse performance across different days/weeks/months

But the raw data had **data quality issues** (date/time formats missing values, etc.), so SQL cleaning was essential

---

## SQL Cleaning Techniques Used

- Importing raw CSV into SQL Server
- Using `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and `INTO`
- Inspecting the dataset with various queries
- Creating Helper columns
- Cleaning text fields using `TRIM()`
- Converting formats using `TRY_CONVERT()`
- Checking for duplicates using `DISTINCT`
- Checking for NULL/missing values
- Identifying unusable columns and documenting them
- Creating permanent cleaned data table using `SELECT` `INTO`, before Exporting data to Google sheets 

**Full SQL scripts has been uploaded in the `/SQL` folder.**

***Key Learning:***
> Never clean data blindly - always understand business context first.

## Work Completed So Far

### SQL Data Cleaning
  - Imported dataset into SQL Server
  - Cleaned columns and fixed data types
  - Investigated errors before fixing
  - Exported cleaned data for analysis

### Google Sheets
  - Applied filters and transformations
  - Created Pivot Tables for sales patterns
  - Built Line, Bar, Column, and Pareto charts for analysis
  - Explored visual storytelling logic

### Documentation
  - Created full workflow step-by-step documentation in a Markdown `(.md)` file
  - SQL scripts uploaded
  - Summarised insights and actionable recommendations for the business fully documented in the same Markdown `(.md)` file

## Planned Future Improvements
These steps will be added to expand the project further in future:
- Create ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
- Build Power BI dashboard (portfolio expansion)

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I became proficient in my understanding of real-world Data problems, Data cleaning logic and judgement, SQL confidence, and Markdown `(.md)` file's workflow documentation for future data projects.
